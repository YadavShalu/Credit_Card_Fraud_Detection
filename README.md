## 1. Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

This documentation provides an overview and guide for the Credit Card Fraud Detection Machine Learning project. The project aims to develop a machine learning model that can detect fraudulent credit card transactions, helping financial institutions identify and prevent fraudulent activities.

## 2. Project Overview<a name="project-overview"></a>

Credit card fraud is a significant concern in the financial industry, causing substantial financial losses for both banks and customers. Machine learning techniques can play a crucial role in detecting fraudulent transactions in real-time, reducing these losses. This project utilizes a dataset containing labeled credit card transactions to train and evaluate a fraud detection model.

## 3. Dataset<a name="dataset"></a>

The dataset used in this project is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) from Kaggle. It contains credit card transactions, including both legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with a small percentage of fraudulent transactions. Please refer to the Kaggle page for more details on the dataset.
